             <h1>HardDisk</h1>
             <p>
                * Hard disk is the most common storage device in the computer system.<br>
                * It is also known as Harddrive, fixed disk drive etc.<br>
                * It is used to store data and program permenant manner ,that is it does not get erased even when the computeris switched off.<br>
                * This device is also known as hard disk because it's hard, rigid and made eith aluminium or    glass-ceramic materials(disk platter).<br>
                * Information is stored in the hard disk by using a maganetic recording method.<br>
            </p>

            <h1>Harddisk Components</h1>
            <p>
                1.Disk Platter<br>
                2.Read/Write Head<br>
                3.Head Arm/ Head Slider<br>
                4.Head activator Mechanism<br>

                8.Bezel<br>
                9.Cable and Connector<br>
            </p>
            
            <h1>Disk Platter</h1>
            <p>
                * Most common size - 3 and a half inch<br>
                * Portable Computer Platter size - 2 and a half<br>
                * Latest small platter - 1 and a half inch<br>
                <br>
                * Available in 10MB or more<br>
                * Number of platter can be from 1 to 10 (Common number used is 2 or 3 )<br>
                * Made from alluminium alloy for the light weight,But alluminium metal is not thermally stable <br>
                * Leading to use glass/glass-ceramic compound.<br>
                   -more storage,small size<br>
                * Material used for platter is called Substrate.<br>
                <br>
                * Two types of coating are ther for coating the disk platter<br>
                  1.Iron Oxide<br>
                  2.Thin film media<br>
                <h1>Iron oxide</h1>
                <p>
                    * Iron oxide componet is used for the coating.<br>
                    * 30 micron inch size.<br>
                    * Not possible for high density storage.<br>
                    * Crashes can easily occur if scracthes are present.<br>
                    * Tradition method of coating.
                </p>
                <h1>Thin Film Media</h1>
                <p>
                    * Thickness is 1 to 4 micron inches.<br>
                    * Very hard and perfect and so can withstand crashes<br>
                    * Two methods to achieve this coating are:<br>
                       1.Platting process<br>
                       2.Sputtering process<br>
                 </p>
                
                <h1>Platting Process</h1><br>
                <p>
                    * The disk plate is immersed in diffent chemicals<br>
                </p>
                <h1>Sputtering Process</h1><br>
                <p>
                    * 1st coated with nickel phosphorus<br>
                    * 2nd 1 to 2 micron inch of cobalt alloy material is deposited<br>
                    * 3rd Carbon is coated for protection<br>
                    * This coating helps to survive Head crashes.<br>
                    * Cost of coating is very high.
                </p>

                <h1>Read/Write Head</h1>
                <p>
                    * Used to read/write information on the disk.<br>
                    * Each surface contains a head for reading and writing.<br>
                    * Single unit movement ,in and out.<br>
                    * Head is close to the disk surface when the harddisk is at rest.<br>
                    * When the disk rotates on a very high speed air pressure develops between the head and the disk surface.This creates a gap of 3 to 10 micron inches.That is there is no direct contact between the head and the disk surafce.
                    * Rotating speed of disk surface is 3600 to 7200 rpm<br>
                    * Dust particles can make permenent damage.So harddisk are manufactured in class 100 clean rooms.<br>
                    * When damaged hardisk are usually replaced than repairing due ti the require ment of a highly clean place to do so.
                </p>

                <h1>Types Of Head:</h1>
                <p>1. Ferrite Head<br>
                   2. Metal-in-gap Head<br>
                   3. Thin film Head<br>

                <h1>Ferrite Head</h1>
                <p>
                    * This was used in the original harddisk drive.<br>
                    * The head is made of Iron-oxide core wrapped with electro-magnetic coils.<br>
                    * Read or Writing of information is achieved by energizing the coil, That is applying magnetic filed.<br>
                    * Not suitable for high storage.
                </p>

                    <h1>Metal-in-gap Head</h1>
                    <p>
                        * Unlike ferrite head high storge is suitable.<br>
                        * A metal alloy is placed between the recording gap.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Thin-Film Head</h1>
                    <p>
                       * 2 micron inch head is used therefore light weight.<br>
                       * Photo-lithographic process is used to make this type of head.<br>
                       * Iron-Nickel alloy core is used.<br>
                       * 2 to 4 times more magnetically powerfull.<br>
                       * Costly.<br>
                       * High density sotrage suitable.

                        * IBM developed.<br>
                        * Read/Write is achieved by changing the resistance.<br>
                        * Separate heads for reading and writing.So proper recording gaps for can be maintained.<br>
                        * Proper covering is required and electro- static discharges may occur.
