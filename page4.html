            <h1>What  is computer Graphics?</h1>
            <p>
                display a picture of any size on a computer screen is a difficult process. Computer graphics are used to simplify this process.<br>
                Various algorithms and techniques are used to generate graphics in computers.<br>
                Computer graphics is an art of drawing pictures on computer screens with the help of programming.<br> 
                It involves computations, creation, and manipulation of data.<br> 
                In other words, we can say that computer graphics is a rendering tool for the generation and manipulation of images.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Why is computer graphics important?</h1>
            <p>
                The importance of computer graphics lies in its applications. In engineering applications (e.g. automotive and aerospace), the ability to quickly visualize newly designed shapes is indispensable. Before the advent of computer graphics, designers built expensive prototypes and time-consuming clay models. Now, designers can interactively view and modify models of their shapes using a computer.<br>
                Medical imaging is another application where computer graphics has proven valuable.<br>
                Recent advances in imaging technology such as computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging allow physicians to take 3D Xrays of the human body. Interactive computer graphics allows the physician to interpret this large volume of data in new and useful ways.<br>
                Computer graphics has also expanded the boundaries of art and entertainment.<br> 
                Movies such as Jurassiac Park make extensive use of computer graphics to create images that test the bounds of imagination.<br> 
                The development of computer graphics has made possible virtual reality, a synthetic reality that exists only inside a computer.<br> 
                Virtual reality is fast becoming an indispensable tool in education.<br> 
                Flight simulators are used to train pilot for extreme conditions.<br>
                Surgical simulators are used to train novice surgeons without endangering patients.

            <h1>GRAPHS AND CHARTS</h1>
            <p>
                An early application for computer graphics is the display of simple data graphs, usually plotted on a character printer.<br> 
                Data plotting is still one of the most common graphics applications, but today we can easily generate graphs showing highly complex data relationships for printed reports or for presentations using 35 mm slides, transparencies, or animated videos.<br> 
                Graphs and charts are commonly used to summarize financial, statistical, mathematical, scientific, engineering, and economic data for research reports, managerial summaries, consumer information bulletins, and other types of publications.
