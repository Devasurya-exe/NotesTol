            <h1>What  is computer Graphics?</h1>
            <p>
                * To display a picture of any size on a computer screen is a difficult process. Computer graphics are used to simplify this process.<br>
                * Various algorithms and techniques are used to generate graphics in computers.<br>
                * Computer graphics is an art of drawing pictures on computer screens with the help of programming.<br> 
                * It involves computations, creation, and manipulation of data.<br> 
                * In other words, we can say that computer graphics is a rendering tool for the generation and manipulation of images.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Why is computer graphics important?</h1>
            <p>
                * The importance of computer graphics lies in its applications. In engineering applications (e.g. automotive and aerospace), the ability to quickly visualize newly designed shapes is indispensable. Before the advent of computer graphics, designers built expensive prototypes and time-consuming clay models. Now, designers can interactively view and modify models of their shapes using a computer.<br>
                * Medical imaging is another application where computer graphics has proven valuable.<br>
                * Recent advances in imaging technology such as computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging allow physicians to take 3D Xrays of the human body. Interactive computer graphics allows the physician to interpret this large volume of data in new and useful ways.<br>
                * Computer graphics has also expanded the boundaries of art and entertainment.<br> 
                * Movies such as Jurassiac Park make extensive use of computer graphics to create images that test the bounds of imagination.<br> 
                * The development of computer graphics has made possible virtual reality, a synthetic reality that exists only inside a computer.<br> 
                * Virtual reality is fast becoming an indispensable tool in education.<br> 
                * Flight simulators are used to train pilot for extreme conditions.<br>
                * Surgical simulators are used to train novice surgeons without endangering patients.

            </p>

            <h1>Working of Interactive Computer Graphics</h1>
            <p>
                The modern graphics display is very simple in construction. It consists of three components:<br>
                * Frame Buffer or Digital Memory<br>
                * A Monitor likes a home T.V. set without the tuning and receiving electronics.<br>
                * Display Controller or Video Controller: It passes the contents of the frame buffer to the monitor.
            </p>

            <h1>Frame Buffer:</h1>
            <p>
                A digital frame buffer is large, contiguous piece of computer memory used to hold or map the image displayed on the screen.<br>
                * At a minimum, there is 1 memory bit for each pixel in the raster. This amount of memory is called a bit plane.<br>
                * A 1024 x 1024 element requires 220 (210=1024;220=1024 x 1024)sq.raster or 1,048,576 memory bits in a single bit plane.<br>
                *  The picture is built up in the frame buffer one bit at a time.<br>
                ∵ A memory bit has only two states (binary 0 or 1), a single bit plane yields a black and white (monochrome display).<br>
               *  As frame buffer is a digital device write raster CRT is an analog device.
            </p>

            <h1>Properties of Video Monitor:</h1>
            <p>
                1. Persistence: Persistence is the duration of phosphorescence. Different kinds of phosphors are available for use in CRT. Besides color, a major difference between phosphor in their persistence how they continue to emit light after the electron beam is removed.<br>
                2. Resolution: Use to describe the number of pixels that are used on display image.<br>
                3. Aspect Ratio: It is the ratio of width to its height. Its measure is unit in length or number of pixels.
